**Goal of the assignment:**

Build an Inventory in Unreal which opens by pressing I on your keyboard and closes also if you press I again. The inventory should show all the items you collected while playing the game. Items should be collected by pressing E on your keyboard and you should at least have two different kinds of Items.

How to: 

- Creating a PDA which is the base of your item representing DataAssets
- Creating an Actor which is the actual presentation of your items in the game
- Creating a component which you add to the character to add the inventory feature
- Creating an interface to collect items in the game
- Creating a custom Player controller, to open and close the Inventory UI
- Creating Window UI in which you can check out the collected items

*Stretch Goal:
Add the inventory component also to an actor and make for example a chest where you can transfer items into and grab them again.*
